"""
https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONHASHSEED
If PYTHONHASHSEED is not set or set to random, a random value is used to to seed the hashes of str and bytes objects.
If PYTHONHASHSEED is set to an integer value, it is used as a fixed seed for generating the hash() of the types covered by the hash randomization.
Its purpose is to allow repeatable hashing, such as for selftests for the interpreter itself, or to allow a cluster of python processes to share hash values.
The integer must be a decimal number in the range [0,4294967295]. Specifying the value 0 will disable hash randomization.

https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/hash
hash(object) returns the hash value of the object (if it has one). Hash values are integers.
They are used to quickly compare dictionary keys during a dictionary lookup.
Numeric values that compare equal have the same hash value even if they are of different types, as is the case for 1 and 1.0.
For objects with custom __hash__() methods, note that hash() truncates the return value based on the bit width of the host machine.
"""

# hash for integer unchanged
print('The hash for 1 is:', hash(1))

# hash for decimal
print('The hash for 1.0 is:',hash(1.0))
print('The hash for 3.14 is:',hash(3.14))

# hash for string
print('The hash for Python is:', hash('Python'))

# hash for a tuple of vowels
vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
print('The hash for a tuple of vowels is:', hash(vowels))

# hash for a custom object
class Person:
    def __init__(self, age, name):
        self.age = age
        self.name = name
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.age == other.age and self.name == other.name
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((self.age, self.name))
person = Person(23, 'Adam')
print('The hash for an object of person is:', hash(person))
pi@raspberrypi:~/iot/lesson10 $ python3 hash_value.py 
The hash for 1 is: 1
The hash for 1.0 is: 1
The hash for 3.14 is: 322818021289917443
The hash for Python is: 8386836988663938715
The hash for a tuple of vowels is: -6383910483621438921
The hash for an object of person is: -345019248133906988
pi@raspberrypi:~/iot/lesson10 $ python3 hash_value.py 
The hash for 1 is: 1
The hash for 1.0 is: 1
The hash for 3.14 is: 322818021289917443
The hash for Python is: 4181409961572195545

```
Here we can see two hash values are different for the lower 3 variables, Python, "a tuple of vowels" and and a person().
## SHA-2 Secure Hash Algorithm
Here we use the python 3 console to generate a 256 bit, 32 byte SHA-256 hash. 
```
pi@raspberrypi:~/iot/lesson10 $ python3
Python 3.9.2 (default, Feb 28 2021, 17:03:44) 
[GCC 10.2.1 20210110] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import hashlib
>>> m = hashlib.sha256(b"hello, world")
>>> m.hexdigest()
'09ca7e4eaa6e8ae9c7d261167129184883644d07dfba7cbfbc4c8a2e08360d5b'
>>> m.digest_size
32
>>> m.block_size
64
>>> exit()
```
We can see that the hash created has a size of 32 bytes and a block size of 64 bits
